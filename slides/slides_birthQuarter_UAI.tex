\frametitle{Introduction}
In this paper we argue that there is a \emph{demand} for ``good'' season of
birth.
\\
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Biological constraints exist which facilitate/impede the ability to achieve
  desired season
\item There is a willingess to pay to achieve good birth seasons
\item Here we document the interaction between biological and economic constraints
\item This has a striking effect on maternal characteristics by season
\item But, demand for season can't explain the entire ``good season advantage''
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Introduction -- Season of Birth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Season of birth consequences?
\begin{itemize}
\item educational attainment and earnings (Angrist and Krueger, 1991)
\item health at birth (Currie and Schwandt, 2013)
\end{itemize}
\item Season of birth mechanisms?
\begin{itemize}
\item random: school cutoff laws (Angrist and Krueger, 1991)
\item non-random: selection of mothers (Buckles and Hungerman, 2013)
\item pseudo-random: weather (colder) season (Currie and Schwandt, 2013)
\end{itemize}
\item ``Good'' and ``bad'' seasons
\begin{itemize}
\item colder months are bad: quarters 1 and 4
\item Spring and Summer are good: quarters 2 and 3
\item at least in the US
\end{itemize}
\item Mechanisms consistent with both: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Biology (weather/influenza effects)
\item Choice/Preferences 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Related literature}
\begin{itemize}
\item Barreca et al. (2015): individuals may make short shifts in conception month in response to very hot days, with resulting declines and rebounds in the following months
\item Choice of exact timing (\emph{after} conception occurs): joint decision of parents and physicians to alter the delivery of an already existing pregnancy
\begin{itemize}
\item Japan: many births between December and January are shifted one week forward around the \underline{school entry cutoff date} (Shigeoka, 2015)
\item US: parents may move expected January births backwards to December to gain \underline{tax benefits} (Dickert-Colin and Chandra, 1999; LaLumia et al., 2015)
\item Australia: parents move forward June deliveries to become eligible for a \underline{``baby bonus''} (Gans and Leigh, 2009)
\item Fewer births are documented on:
\begin{itemize}
\item holidays (Rindfuss et al., 1979)
\item weekends (Gould et al., 2003)
\item medical professional meeting dates (Ganes et al., 2007)
\item less auspicious dates (Almond et al., 2015)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{This paper}
Season of birth is a choice made \emph{entirely before} (and perhaps well before) conception occurs.

\begin{itemize}
\item First economic analysis disentangling behavioral from biological responses
\item Exploiting differences by ART, occupation and weather
\item Censal evidence, own survey evidence (and \hyperlink{anecdotes}{considerable \textcolor{blue}{anecdotal evidence}})

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)}: 2005-2013
\item Main analysis: Singleton first births born to White Non-Hispanic married women in the US 20(25)-45 years old (\hyperlink{ageHist}{\textcolor{blue}{selection?}}).
\begin{itemize}
\item First births: higher-order births also involve the additional decision of birth spacing and the role of experience (does planning improve with higher-order pregnancies?)
%\item Additional material (not here): using second-births, including twins, fetal deaths, etc.
\end{itemize}
\item Season of birth is defined as the \emph{expected} (intended) season of birth: actual month of birth --  gestational length in months + 9 months
\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on the planning of season of birth: the decision to conceive
\end{itemize}
\item Temperature? National Centers for Environmental Information
\item Occupation? \textbf{American Community Survey (ACS)}: 2005-2014 (representative 1\% of the US population)

\frametitle{Alternative explanations?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Birth seasonality pattern inconsistent with marriage seasonality timing (Lam et al., 1999): inconsistent with Honeymoon effects
\item Birth seasonality pattern linked to seasonality at which women stop contracepting (Rodgers and Udry,  1998)
\item Women on average take 6 months to get pregnant after stopping contracepting: our estimates provide lower bounds
\item The observed seasonality patterns cannot be explained by the fact that the sperm is better in Winter and early Spring (Levitas et al., 2013)
\item Winter months may be tougher birth months because of \underline{cold} weather and \underline{higher disease} prevalence (Buckles and Hungerman, 2013; Currie and Schwandt, 2013).  However, very hard to justify the multiple gradients in age, occupation, ART\ldots

\item Controlling for state specific linear trends and unemployment rate at season of conception (Table 4A)
\item Including second births (Table 5A)
\item Including \hyperlink{twins}{\textcolor{blue}{Twins}} (Table 6A)
\item Focusing only on twin births (Table 7A: only without ART is positively correlated with good season)

\frametitle{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Season of birth is a matter of choice/preferences above and beyond biology.
\item It is difficult to reconcile the stylised facts documented here with competing explanations, especially when these explanations are constant throughout the US, or across industries (eg influenza)
\item Mothers who can respond to incentives, do respond to incentives, and these incentives are not universally for one quarter
\item Even conditional exogeneity-type assumptions are likely to fail

%\frametitle{Summary -- The Facts}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Good season of birth is non-monotonically related to mother's age.
%\item Good season of birth is positively related to mother's education.
%\item Good season of birth is negatively related to mother's smoking during pregnancy.
%\item Good season of birth is more likely among non-ART users.
%\item The prevalence of good season in Spring/Summer is higher in states with more severe cold weather in Winter.
%\item Good season is more likely among mother in professions in which strong seasonality of work hours exists (such as educators).
%\item Mothers in non-teacher occupations are paid a compensating differential: upper bound for the value of season of birth.
%\item Controlling for maternal characteristics reduces, but certainly doesn't eliminate, the good season advantage.

\frametitle{Conclusion}
This looks like a constrained choice, or \underline{demand for season of birth}.
\vspace{3mm} \\
\begin{itemize}
\item We observe a \emph{Revealed Preference} for spring/summer births in the universe of births
\item We observe an \emph{Explicitly Stated Preference} for these births in new survey data
\item Ongoing work: How do we remove priming effects to confirm preferences?

  \frametitle{More Details: Equalizing Differences}
  Suppose a woman can choose between two types of jobs: teacher $D=0$ or non-teacher $D=1$. Non-teachers are paid $w_1$, and teachers $w_0$.
  \vspace{2mm}
  
  Assume her preferences can be represented by the following utility function

  \[
    U(C,D).
  \]

  We assume that, \emph{ceteris paribus}, a teacher job is preferred to a non-teacher job

  \[
    U(C,0) \geq U(C,1).
  \]

  How much income (or consumption) must the woman be compensated with to undertake the less preferred job?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{More Details: Equalizing Differences}
  Let $C_0$ be the consumption when $D=0$, and define $\widetilde{C}$ as the consumption level required to achieve the same utility in a non-teacher job

  \[
    U(\widetilde{C},1) = U(C_0,0)
  \]

  Hence, $\widetilde{C} \geq C_0$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{More Details: Equalizing Differences}
  Let $\Delta w = w_1 - w_0$ be the market equalizing difference: the non-teacher job offers $\Delta w$ units of consumption for worse ``working'' conditions: \emph{the implicit price of all the amenities of a teacher job}. \vspace{4mm}

  The woman chooses the non-teacher job ($D=1$) if and only if
  \[
    U(\Delta w + C_0,1)>U(C_0,0)=u(\widetilde{C},1)=u(C_0 + z, 1)
  \]
  where $z = \widetilde{C} - C_0$ is the compensating variation.

  \vspace{4mm}
  Thus, she chooses the non-teacher job if and only if
  \[
    \Delta w > z.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{effects} of the season of birth are clear:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item child health, educational attainment, labor market
        \item Angrist and Krueger (1991), Buckles and Hungerman (2013), Currie and Schwandt (2013)
        %\item Crawford et al.\ (2014)
        %\item Currie and Schwandt (2013)
      \end{itemize}
\item Although no consensus yet on the main driving force:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item selection (of mothers), weather (colder)
      \end{itemize}
\item There are ``good'' and ``bad'' seasons
      \begin{itemize}
\item Colder months are bad: quarters 1 and 4
\item Spring and Summer are good: quarters 2 and 3
\item At least in the US

\begin{itemize}
\item No analysis of the \emph{determinants} of the season of birth of a child
\item No study has yet considered season of birth as a choice variable
\item Prominence of family planning in people's work and family life, sense that winter may represent tougher birth months for weather/diseases and different work commitments
\item We consider \underline{when} to have their \underline{first} child:
\begin{itemize}
  \item When (\underline{young or old}) and in \underline{which season} (quarter of birth)?
%  \item Focus on SOB decision, take age of mother as given
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Anecdotal evidence}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``The preconception period (three months prior to pregnancy) is the time to make life changes that can help boost fertility, reduce problems during pregnancy and assist in recovery from birth.''
\item ``When you start thinking about becoming pregnant you should take a look at your health and that of your partner. Try to give yourselves three months to prepare for pregnancy.''
\item http://boards.weddingbee.com/topic/\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{choosing-which-month-your-baby-will-be-born-in}/
\item comparison of the four seasons:

\end{itemize}
\item ``It's certainly not a bad time to give birth -- less fears of germs getting your baby sick and plenty of sunshiney days for backyard birthday parties when they're older.''
\item ``Summer is a great season for your maternity leave to fall on ...''
\item ``All saved their sick days for many years before getting pregnant or had early summer babies on purpose!''
\item ``If we were to conceive now, the baby would be due around six weeks before summer break next year so I basically wouldn't finish the school year as leave would end after post planning.''%  Would I still receive my summer pay or would they try to not pay me for not finishing the year?''

\frametitle{What do we do?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We establish new stylized facts on the choice of season of birth:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced-form estimates of season of birth correlates
\begin{itemize}
\item By age group of the mother,
\item By cold weather patterns,
\item By ART usage
\item Using month of birth, or month of conception + 9 months
\end{itemize}
\item Reduced-form estimates of birth quality correlates

%\item Use gestation weeks to further disentangle the \emph{intended} from the \emph{realized} good and bad seasons
\end{itemize}
\item We estimate a structural model where:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item mother's age (young vs.\ old) and SOB (good vs.\ bad)  are choice variables
%        \item SOB is choice variable
      \end{itemize}
\item We estimate the value of SOB in terms of trade-off between birth quality (mother's well-being) and earnings (biological and economic constraints)
%\item Value of SOB and postponing fertility, trade-off:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item Postpone (old): earnings increase but good season less likely
       \item Not to postpone (young): earnings decrease but good season more likely
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item White and non-Hispanic women who had their first-born child
        \item Singletons (we also look at twins)
        \item Mothers aged 25-45
        \item 2005-2013

\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Good season of birth is non-monotonically related to mother's age.
\item Good season of birth is positively related to mother's education.
\item Good season of birth is negatively related to mother's smoking during pregnancy.
\item Good season of birth is more likely among non-ART users.
\item Season of birth is uncorrelated to mother's characteristics among ART users.
\item The prevalence of good season in Spring/Summer is higher in states with more severe cold weather in Winter.
\item Good season is more likely among mother in professions in which strong seasonality of work hours exists (such as educators).
\item Mothers in non-teacher occupations are paid a compensating differential: upper bound for the value of season of birth.
\item Among those babies achieved through ART, good season of birth seems to be positively related with birth outcomes: lower bound of the causal effect of good season of birth on birth outcomes.
